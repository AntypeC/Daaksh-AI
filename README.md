# Daaksh-AI
Presenting Daaksh Raj Dhariwal, the apex of personal genius, powered by cutting-edge AI. Clone this repository locally to get started, then insert your Hugging FaceÂ API key in the javascript file. If you want to host it locally, you can use http-server or live-server.

**Getting started** <br />
The first step is to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/AntypeC/Daaksh-AI.git```

This will create a new folder called "Daaksh-AI" in your current directory.

Next, open the "js/script.js" file in a text editor. You will need to insert your Hugging Face API key in the file. Locate the following line of code:

```API_KEY = "";```

Replace the empty string with your API key in quotes.

```API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";```

Save the file and close the text editor.

Using the chatbot
Now that you have the repository cloned and the API key set up, you can use the chatbot to have engaging conversations. To start a conversation, open the "index.html" file in a web browser. You will see a chat interface with a message from Daaksh Raj Dhariwal.

Type your message in the text box at the bottom of the screen and press "Enter" or click the "Send" button to send your message. Daaksh Raj Dhariwal will respond with a message of his own. You can continue the conversation by typing more messages and sending them.

The chatbot has two modes: casual and serious. To switch between the two modes, click the "Casual" or "Serious" button in the top right corner of the screen. In casual mode, the chatbot uses the Facebook Blenderbot 400M Distilled model to generate responses. In serious mode, the chatbot uses a different model to generate responses.
